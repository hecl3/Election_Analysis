# Election_Analysis
Overview
  For this project, I was tasked to tally the results of a Colorado Congressional election. I needed to do the following:
    1. Find the total number of votes cast
    2. Compile a complete list of candidates who received votes
    3. Find the percentage of votes each candidate won
    4. Determine the total number of votes each candidate won
    5. Determine the winner of the election based on the popular vote.

# Overview of Election Audit
I was asked to further quantify my data by finding the following:
  1. The voter turnout for each county
  2. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
  3. The county with the highest turnout
The results were as follows:
  County Votes:
Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)
-------------------------
Winner: Denver
Winning Vote Count: 306,055

Summary
Denver county by far had the greatest voter turn out at 82.8%, or 306,055 of the total voters. The next highest was Jefferson county accounting for 10.5% of the votes (38,855), and Araphahoe accounting for 6.7%. (24,801). 

This code can be used for other elections. To change it based on needs, you could modify it to show voter count for each candidate based on county.
